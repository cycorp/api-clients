/**
 * Provides the classes specific to working with query searches.
 *
 * Query searches retrieve building blocks (and in some cases, fully specified
 * queries) for constructing useful queries based on natural-language input. The
 * building blocks can include terms identified in the NL input string, as well
 * as "query fragments" consisting of simple formulas with typically just one
 * predicate, some terms, and some variables. These can be combined to form a more
 * complex query that comes closer to the intended meaning of the NL input.
 * 
 * See com.cyc.km.query.construction.QuerySearchExamples in CoreAPIUseCases for examples of how this process can work.
