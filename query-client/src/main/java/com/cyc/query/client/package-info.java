/**
 * Provides the core classes for constructing, specifying, and running Cyc
 * queries. Queries are requests to Cyc to either confirm that something is
 * true, or else to find bindings for open {@link com.cyc.kb.Variable}s that result in true
 * sentences. They can be asked from different {@link com.cyc.kb.Context}s, and given
 * different resource constraints, using {@link com.cyc.base.inference.InferenceParameters}.
 * <p/>
 * Results can be inspected either while a query is running, or after it has
 * finished. {@link com.cyc.query.QueryListener}s can be defined to handle query-related
 * events such as when new answers are found or the query exhausts.
 * <p/>
 * Results can be processed either as {@link com.cyc.query.QueryAnswer}s, or as SQL-style
 * {@link com.cyc.query.KBInferenceResultSet}s.
