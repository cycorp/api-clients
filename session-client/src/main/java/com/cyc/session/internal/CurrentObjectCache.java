/**
 * Cache responsible for storing (and cleaning up after) all "current" objects. Right now 
 * that only means the current CycSession, but could be expanded to manage other resources if 
 * necessary.
 * 
 * <p>Because thread-local resources can be a source of memory leaks (especially in, e.g., servlets)
 * the goal of this class is to encapsulate all code for managing them in one place; there should be
 * no references to ThreadLocals anywhere else in the Session API. The underlying implementation is
 * a ThreadLocal map, but that could change in the future.
