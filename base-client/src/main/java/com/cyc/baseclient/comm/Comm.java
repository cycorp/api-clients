 * <P>Comm is an interface that can be used to create new CycAccess objects
 * such that the actual communications to Cyc is via InputStreams and OutputStreams 
 * managed by the Comm object. This can allow features such as the use of alternate 
 * communications protocols, load balancing, automated server recovery, and 
 * specialized logging without needing any changes to the Base Client directly.
 * 
 * <P>Ex.:
 * <CODE><PRE>
 *  Comm comm = new SocketComm(CycAddress.DEFAULT.getHostName(), CycAddress.DEFAULT.getBasePort());
 *  CycAccess cycAccess = new CycAccess(comm);
