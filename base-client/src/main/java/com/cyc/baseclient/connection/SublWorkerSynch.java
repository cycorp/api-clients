/**
 * <P>WorkerSynch is designed to provide a handle for a particular 
 communication event with a Cyc server in a synchronous manner. 
 DefaultWorkerSynch provides the default
 implementation while Worker and DefaultWorker provide
 asynchronous communications capabilities. Currently, WorkerSynchs are one-shot,
 i.e., a new WorkerSynch needs to be created for every new communication.
 WorkerSynchs are cancelable, time-outable and provide means for incremental
 return results.
  
 <P>Example usage: <pre>
 try {
    CycAccess access = CycAccessManager.getAccess();
    WorkerSynch worker = new DefaultWorkerSynch("(+ 1 1)", access);
    Object work = worker.getWork();
    System.out.println("Got worker: " + worker + "\nGot result: " + work + ".");
  } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
 </pre>
