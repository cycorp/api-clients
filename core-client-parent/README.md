Cyc Core Client Implementation
==============================

**Latest release:** [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.cyc/cyc-core-client-parent.svg)](https://github.com/cycorp/api-clients/releases/)  
**License:** [Apache 2.0](LICENSE)  
**Changes:** See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)  
**Documentation:** [Cyc Developer Center](http://dev.cyc.com/api/core/)  

The Cyc Core Client provides the reference implementation for the Cyc Core API Specification, which
may be found in the [`api-suite`](https://github.com/cycorp/api-suite) repository, in the 
`core-api` directory. For further details about the Core API, see the project's README.

The Core API Specification is the core set of Java APIs for interacting with the Cyc inference
engine and knowledge base. For further details about the Core API, see the project's README.

The Core Client is split along the following modules:

* **KB Client** - Reference implementation of the KB API.
* **Query Client** - Reference implementation of the Query API.
* **Session Client** - Reference implementation of the Session API.
* **Base Client** - Underlying client for connecting to a Cyc server and handling HL data;
  _not supported for external developers_.
* **Core Client Implementation Bundle** - Packages all the other Core Client implementation modules
  into a single artifact.


Requirements
------------

### Java

* Java 8 or greater to run, `JDK 1.8` or greater to build.
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) version `3.2` or higher to build the sources. If you are
  new to Maven, you may wish to view the [quick start](http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html).

The APIs may be used without Maven via the `cyc-core-client-impl-1.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
See [Standalone Bundle](#standalone-bundle), below.

### Cyc Server

The following Cyc server releases are supported:

* **ResearchCyc 4.0q** or higher. Requires [server code patching](server-patching.md).
* **EnterpriseCyc 1.7-preview** or higher. Requires [server code patching](server-patching.md).

For inquiries about obtaining a suitable version of Cyc, please visit the
[Cyc Dev Center downloads page](http://dev.cyc.com/downloads/).


### Server Code Patching

As of version 1.0.0-rc3, the Core Client implementation requires SubL code patches which are not 
present in _ResearchCyc 4.0q_ or _EnterpriseCyc 1.7-preview_. These patches can be applied manually,
or they can be automatically applied by the API bundle itself.

See [server-patching.md](server-patching.md) for details.


Downloading
-----------

### Apache Maven

The Core Client requires the Core API spec to be present on the classpath. To use them in a Maven 
project, add the following dependencies to your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
      <!-- Core API specification -->
      <groupId>com.cyc</groupId>
      <artifactId>cyc-core-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <!-- Reference implementation for the Core API -->
      <groupId>com.cyc</groupId>
      <artifactId>cyc-core-client-impl</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>

The Core APIs use the [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) logging API. They do not include a logging
implementation, but instead allow you to specify your own. For example, to use
[Log4J 1.2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/):

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.12</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.17</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>

For more details about logging, see the [Cyc API logging HOWTO](http://dev.cyc.com/api/faq/api-logging.html).


### Standalone Bundle

If you're not using Apache Maven, or can't allow Maven to retrieve dependencies from the Internet,
you may download this release in a standalone bundle containing:

* A standalone jar-with-dependencies for the Core API specification.
* A standalone jar-with-dependencies for the Core Client implementation.
* A test suite. (Requires Maven to compile.)
* Source code. (Requires Maven to compile.)
* Example code. (Requires Maven to compile.)

The bundle is available from the [releases page](https://github.com/cycorp/api-clients/releases/)
as a tar or zip file. See the README in the bundle for details.

To use a standalone jar in a Maven project, use the "jar-with-dependencies" classifier when
specifying the dependency:

    <dependency>
      <!-- Core API specification -->
      <groupId>com.cyc</groupId>
      <artifactId>cyc-core-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0</version>
      <classifier>jar-with-dependencies</classifier>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <!-- Reference implementation for the Core API -->
      <groupId>com.cyc</groupId>
      <artifactId>cyc-core-client-impl</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0</version>
      <classifier>jar-with-dependencies</classifier>
    </dependency>

Note that the dependencies for the logging implementation are _not_ included in these jars, and must
be specified independently. See the previous section for details.


Building the Sources
--------------------

**Note:** Installing this project will run all of the API test suites. It is _strongly recommended_
to only run the API test suites against a _fresh Cyc server instance_ dedicated to that purpose, as 
the API tests can alter a Cyc server's KB contents.

You will first need to have installed the `core-api`, or you will need to build against a released 
version of the core-api. See the core-api's README for details on how to build that project.

Within the `core-client` project, issue the following command:

    mvn install

This will run the test suites for all of the sub-projects, and will pop up a
GUI panel asking for a Cyc server address. If you are running in a headless
environment, or wish to specify the server at the command line, use the
following instead:

    mvn install -Dcyc.session.server=[HOST_NAME]:[BASE_PORT]

For example:

    mvn install -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600

Alternately, if you wish to install without running unit tests:

    mvn install -DskipTests=true

Installing the `core-client` project will install all of its sub-projects. Once
you have done so, you can then re-build or re-install any sub-projects
independently. See each project's `README.md` for details.


Testing the Sources
-------------------

Building the sources (as described above) will automatically run the tests, but you may wish to run
the test suite independently.

**Note:**  It is _strongly recommended_ to only run the test suites against a _fresh Cyc server
instance_ dedicated to that purpose. The tests may alter a Cyc server's KB contents.

Within the core-client project, issue the following command:

    mvn clean verify -Dcyc.session.server=[HOST_NAME]:[BASE_PORT]

E.g.:

    mvn clean verify -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600

Note that we're using Maven's `verify` phase instead of the `test` phase. This is required to
insure that integration tests are included. For more details, see
_Unit tests vs. integration tests_, below.

Test results will be displayed to the console, and saved in `[MODULE]/target/surefire-reports/`.
E.g., test results for the Session Client will be saved in 
`session-client/target/surefire-reports/`, test results for the KB Client will be saved in
`kb-client/target/surefire-reports/`, and so on.

Note that specifying the `clean` goal will cause Maven to delete the `target` directories, and any
existing reports and compiled unit tests, before re-compiling and running the test suites. If you do
not wish to delete the target directories, you can omit the `clean` goal. E.g.:

    mvn verify -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600


### Testing specific modules/sub-projects

To run only the tests for a particular module (sub-project), simply do the above from within that
module's root directory. For example, to run all tests for the Session Client:

    cd session-client
    mvn clean verify -Dcyc.session.server=[HOST_NAME]:[BASE_PORT]


### Running individual tests

You may run a single _unit_ test class from the command line by passing its simple class name as a
property:

    mvn clean test -Dtest=[NAME_OF_TEST] -Dcyc.session.server=[HOST_NAME]:[BASE_PORT]

These tests must be run from the root of the module (sub-project) in which the are contained. For
example, to run the Session Client Implementation's `ConfigurationLoaderManagerTest`:

    cd session-client
    mvn clean test -Dtest=ConfigurationLoaderManagerTest -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600

You may run a single unit test method:

    cd session-client
    mvn clean test -Dtest=CycServerTest#testIsDefined -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600

You may also use patterns to run a number of unit tests from the same project:

    cd session-client
    mvn clean test -Dtest=SessionManagerImplTest,Configuration*Test -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600

_Integration_ tests can also be run individually, but must be run during the `verify` phase:

    cd base-client
    
    mvn verify -Dtest=CycSessionManagerIT -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600
    
    mvn verify -Dtest=CycSessionManagerIT#testSingletonAccessor -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600

Unit test can be run in either the `test` or `verify` phase, so either of these will work:

    cd session-client
    
    mvn clean test -Dtest=ConfigurationLoaderManagerTest -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600
    
    mvn clean verify -Dtest=ConfigurationLoaderManagerTest -Dcyc.session.server=localhost:3600

However, because unit tests don't need the additional Maven integration testing overhead, it's
leanest to run them during the `test` phase, if possible.

For more information, see the [Maven SureFire Plugin examples](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/single-test.html).


### Unit tests vs. integration tests

By default, Maven expects integration tests to be named `**/IT*.java`, `**/*IT.java`, or
`**/*ITCase.java`, and does not run them during the `test` phase. Instead, to allow for setting up
and tearing down the integration test environment, the Maven lifecycle has four phases for
integration testing: `pre-integration-test`, `integration-test`, `post-integration-test`, and
`verify`. To ensure that all of these phases run correctly, it's simplest to just call the `verify`
phase; any unit tests will be run, too.
